Copy paste all the things 😞.

## ℹ️ About

The point of this library is not to provide npm-like packages that fit every use case. Rather, these components are a good starting point for getting you part of the way quickly. You will most likely have to modify them to fit your use case. Good luck 😀.

## 📕 Documentation

Each component includes a `README.md`. Have a look inside and check if you have all the required dependencies. It also shows you who made the component so that you can tag them in an issue if there is something wrong with the component.

## 🖥 Demos

Some components have a demo which shows how the component can be used. The demos are found in the `/demos` folder.

## ⌨️ Contributing

We want your components! Whenever you make a component that feels like it could be useful for other client projects, please consider putting it here by submitting a pull request!
