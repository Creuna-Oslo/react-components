## About the components

The point of this library is not to provide npm-like packages that fit every use case. Rather, these components are a good starting point for getting you half the way quickly. You will most likely have to modify them to fit your use case. Good luck ☺️

#### package.json
Each component includes a `package.json`. You shouldn't put this file into your code base, but do have a look inside and check if you have all the required dependencies. It also shows you who made the component so that you can contact them if you need to.

#### demos
Some components include a demo which shows how the component can be used. Run with `yarn` and then `yarn dev`.

#### contributing
We want your components! Whenever you make a component that feels like it could be useful for other client projects, please consider putting it here!
