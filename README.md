# Creuna React Components

- [Carousel](components/carousel/)
- [FluidImage](components/fluid-image/)
- [Modal](components/modal/)
- [StaticContainer](components/static-container/)

## Usage

Copy paste all the things.

_Or_

These components can be written to your project using the Creuna CLI (`@creuna/cli`). See the [@creuna/cli](https://github.com/Creuna-Oslo/cli) documentation for details.

## About the components

The point of this library is not to provide npm-like packages that fit every use case. Rather, these components are a good starting point for getting you half the way quickly. You will most likely have to modify them to fit your use case. Good luck ☺️

#### Documentation

Each component includes a `README.md`. Have a look inside and check if you have all the required dependencies. It also shows you who made the component so that you can contact them if you need to.

#### demos

Some components have a demo which shows how the component can be used. Run with `yarn` and then `yarn dev`.

#### contributing

We want your components! Whenever you make a component that feels like it could be useful for other client projects, please consider putting it here by submitting a pull request!
